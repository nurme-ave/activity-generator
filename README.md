## Overview

### Project Description

This was a small project I did when I first started working with API's. I'm implementing the fetch()-method here and requesting data from boredapi.com to generate random ideas for different activities.

I'm implementing the fetch()-method here and requesting data from boredapi.com to generate random ideas for different activities.

I designed the page myself and I'm also using the background-blend-mode here to make the page a bit more interesting.

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.
